            We had many Tools.
            Each Tool with a specific Purpose, and only that Purpose.
            Pitchforks to break the mulch.
            A Shovel to lift the soil.
            A Wheelbarrow to haul the load.
            And Rakes to spread the haul.

            To honor a Tool, to utilize its Purpose, to harness it's worth

            born with no Tool

            wading through Earth
            searching for Tool
            groping, crawling, pleading
            For Tool

            and then He finds Tool
            the Tool to achieve His Purpose
            the Tool which could never bend
            or mime breaking or chip or Falter
            the Tool which always will be
            The Tool

            and when He is backthrusted the other way
            to a bigger womb
            the Tool will thrust with Him
            Propelled by the weight of his One Man

            Designed without flaw but left to swelter in the Shed

            no, no, no
            I will do the telling

            it is the Tool which suffers more
            for It suffers by no fault of Its own
            whereas the Man plays His own victim
            the First in a long line, a line in which the Tool plays Caboose

            (ah, imagine that, the absurdity, an item as glorious and heroic as the Tool reduced to playing the Caboose in the Congo-Line of those who suffer through the neglect of the Hands of Man)

            Man may create Tool, but he may destroy Tool as easily

            smiling and waiting
            a big dusty crater photographed on the surface of Pluto

            we can so clearly consider what could have Been
            8 Men, One Tool
                  [or]

            that Illuminated Hand means something
            there is only this
            it is lit by the lamp of a Tool
            a Tool made by Man
            let The hand bathe in this Glow
            and never leave the tub

            A tool shall be used for One Task
            The Task which stoked its Design
            The Design performed by One Man
            desperate to Achieve his Task

            At first it may seem that Tool and Man are of fire and ice
            in constant Struggle
            one melting, another freezing

            oh how the Truth ... is so far away

            Man and Tool are codependent
            without One there is no Other
            Man without Tool is Monkey
            Tool without Man
            is Object
            pitiful Object

            give Him time alone and Man will rot in the dirt
            but give Him time with Shovel, and He will Dig

            Man with only His hand makes semen
            but give Him Hammer, and he will make Skyscraper

            with fingers, fruit
            with Knife, Steak

            yet Shovel without Man is item
            yet Hammer without Man is good
            yet Knife without Man is thing

            is not the Answer clear enough?

            "in Opposition," say you?
            “Hardly,” Man, Tool, and their Purpose heartily answer.

            on Judgement Day
            they will beg for forgiveness

            and He … He will be just fine

            waiting with Father time
            for that day to come

            without a drop of sweat
            with His Tool
            His Task achieved
            His Purpose met
